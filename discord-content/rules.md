> ## 📜 **CloutScape - Server Rules & Guidelines** 📜

To ensure a fair, respectful, and enjoyable environment for everyone, all members are expected to adhere to the following rules. Failure to comply may result in warnings, mutes, kicks, or permanent bans.

### **1. Respect and Common Courtesy**

-   **No Harassment or Hate Speech**: Treat all members with respect. We have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of harassment, bullying, racism, sexism, or hate speech.
-   **No Spamming**: Do not spam channels with excessive messages, images, or mentions. This includes in-game chat.
-   **No Offensive Content**: Do not post or share any content that is sexually explicit, graphically violent, or otherwise inappropriate.

### **2. Account and Gameplay Rules**

-   **One Account Per Person**: Each player is allowed one primary account. Multi-accounting is strictly prohibited and will result in a permanent ban of all associated accounts.
-   **No Botting or Macroing**: The use of any third-party software to automate gameplay is forbidden. Play fair and earn your progress legitimately.
-   **No Bug Abuse**: If you discover a bug, report it immediately to the `#support` channel. Abusing bugs for personal gain will lead to severe penalties.
-   **No Real-World Trading (RWT)**: The buying or selling of in-game items, currency, or accounts for real money is strictly prohibited.

### **3. Discord and Communication**

-   **Use Appropriate Channels**: Keep conversations relevant to the channel's purpose. For example, use `#bot-commands` for bot interactions and `#general` for casual chat.
-   **No Advertising**: Do not advertise other Discord servers, websites, or services without explicit permission from an admin.
-   **No Impersonation**: Do not impersonate staff members or other players.

### **4. PvP and Gambling Conduct**

-   **Honorable PvP**: While the Wilderness is a dangerous place, excessive griefing or targeting of players outside of fair PvP is discouraged.
-   **No Scamming**: Scamming other players in trades, duels, or any other activity will result in an immediate and permanent ban.
-   **Responsible Gambling**: Gamble within your means. Do not harass others for loans or stake money.

Our goal is to build a community that is both competitive and supportive. Let's work together to make CloutScape the best RSPS experience for everyone.
