## 3. TikTok / Instagram Reels Concepts

**Concept 1: "The Crash Cash-Out" (10-15 seconds)**

*   **Visuals**: Fast-paced montage. Start with a close-up of the Crash multiplier rapidly increasing. Quick cuts to a player's excited face (or a stylized avatar). Show the cash-out button being pressed just before the crash. End with a massive GP balance increase.
*   **Audio**: Trending, high-tension sound clip that builds up, then a satisfying 
sound effect for the win.
*   **Text Overlay**: "CRASH! Can you time it?" "Cashed out at 15.3x!" "Play CloutScape. Link in bio."
*   **Call to Action**: "Link in Bio to Play!"

**Concept 2: "Keno 40 - The Lucky Numbers" (10-15 seconds)**

*   **Visuals**: Dynamic animation of the Keno 40 board. Highlight selected numbers. Show the drawn numbers appearing rapidly, with hits glowing green. Build up to a big win with multiple hits.
*   **Audio**: Upbeat, exciting music. Sound effects for each number drawn and a distinct "cha-ching" for a win.
*   **Text Overlay**: "Pick your lucky numbers!" "Keno 40: Big wins, fast pace!" "CloutScape.org - Try Keno now!"
*   **Call to Action**: "Link in Bio to Play!"

**Concept 3: "Syndicate - Passive GP" (15-20 seconds)**

*   **Visuals**: Start with a player looking bored, then a notification pops up: "GP Earned: 500,000." Show a quick transition to the Syndicate dashboard with increasing numbers for "Total Earned." Show a quick cut to a player enjoying their GP in-game (e.g., buying an expensive item).
*   **Audio**: Relaxed, aspirational music. Sound effect for the GP notification.
*   **Text Overlay**: "Earn GP while you sleep?" "The CloutScape Syndicate: Your network, your net worth." "Join the elite. Link in bio."
*   **Call to Action**: "Link in Bio to Join Syndicate!"
